## 🚀 QUICK SETUP (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start Public Access Server
```bash
cd /Users/nahomnigatu/Downloads/campusministrybadges
./start_public_access.sh
```

**This will:**
- Start your admin server
- Create a public tunnel (secure HTTPS)
- Display your public URL
- Show setup instructions

### Step 2: Generate QR Codes
```bash
# Replace with YOUR public URL from step 1
python3 generate_public_qr.py https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

**This creates:**
- `public_qr_codes/checkin_qr_public.png` - For attendees
- `public_qr_codes/admin_qr_public.png` - For staff

### Step 3: Print & Post QR Codes
- **Check-in QR**: Print and post at entrance/registration tables
- **Admin QR**: Give to staff for quick admin access

### Step 4: You're Done! 🎉

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If QR codes don't work:
1. Make sure `start_public_access.sh` is still running
2. Check that the public URL is still active
3. Regenerate QR codes if URL changed

### If attendees can't access:
1. Verify they have internet connection (cellular or WiFi)
2. Try visiting the URL in a regular browser
3. Check if ngrok tunnel is still active

### If admin panel won't load:
1. Make sure admin_server.py is running
2. Try accessing via the public URL + `/docs/admin.html`
3. Check password is `campus2024`
